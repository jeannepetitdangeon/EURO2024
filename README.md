# EURO2024

1. Data Collection:
   Using data from “archives”.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   Clean, preprocess, and prepare the data for modeling. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features. Create a target variable that represents the match outcomes (e.g., "win," "draw," "loss").
3. Feature Engineering:
   Create new features that can help improve the model's predictive performance. Features might include historical team performance, head-to-head statistics, player form, and other relevant attributes that can impact match outcomes.
4. Data Splitting:
   Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is reserved for evaluating the model's performance.
5. Model Selection:
   Choose an appropriate supervised learning algorithm for your football predictor. Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. The selection depends on the complexity of the problem and the amount of data available.
6. Model Training:
   Train the selected model on the training data using the features and target variable. The model will learn to predict match outcomes based on the provided historical data.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning : 
Optimize the hyperparameters of the model using the validation set to improve its performance. Techniques like cross-validation and grid search can help you find the best hyperparameter values.
8. Model Evaluation :
   Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics. Common metrics for classification problems like this include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC curve. Consider using metrics like log-loss or Brier score for probabilistic predictions.
9. Prediction and Deployment :
  Once you have a trained and well-performing model, you can use it to predict match outcomes for EURO 2024. The predictions can be made for each match in the tournament as new data becomes available.

Remember that the accuracy of your predictor depends on the quality and quantity of data, the features you use, and the choice of the algorithm. Building a successful football predictor often requires continuous refinement and updates to stay accurate as the tournament progresses. Additionally, sports predictions can be influenced by many unpredictable factors, so no model can guarantee 100% accuracy.
